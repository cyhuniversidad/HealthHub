Welcome to this video about diabetes, a chronic disease that affects the way the body converts food into energy.
Today, we’ll explain the types of diabetes, their symptoms, causes, and treatment options.

00:00:14.698 --> 00:00:23.029
Let’s start with Type 1 diabetes. This type of diabetes is an autoimmune condition
where the immune system attacks the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas.

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:31.028
Symptoms: Common symptoms include increased thirst, frequent urination, extreme hunger,
unintended weight loss, and fatigue.

00:00:32.027 --> 00:00:37.026
Causes: Its primary cause is genetic, though environmental factors can trigger its onset.

00:00:37.026 --> 00:00:44.025
Treatment: Treatment requires daily insulin use, along with constant monitoring of blood glucose levels.

00:00:45.358 --> 00:00:54.023
Now, let’s move on to Type 2 diabetes. This type is the most common and is characterized by insulin resistance,
meaning the body does not use insulin efficiently.

00:00:55.023 --> 00:01:01.355
Symptoms: Symptoms can be similar to those of type 1 diabetes but usually develop more gradually,
and sometimes, there may be no obvious symptoms.

00:01:02.355 --> 00:01:09.353
Causes: The main causes include lifestyle factors, such as obesity, inactivity, and genetic factors.

00:01:10.187 --> 00:01:16.685
Treatment: Treatment generally involves a combination of lifestyle changes, oral medications,
and, in some cases, insulin.

00:01:17.352 --> 00:01:28.350
Lastly, we have Type 3 diabetes. This term is sometimes used to refer to insulin resistance in the brain,
which may be linked to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s.

00:01:29.016 --> 00:01:33.349
Symptoms: Symptoms include memory problems and other cognitive issues that may worsen over time.

00:01:33.849 --> 00:01:42.347
Causes: Causes are believed to be related to risk factors similar to those of type 2 diabetes,
along with factors that impact brain function.

00:01:42.847 --> 00:01:50.679
Treatment: Although still under research, treatment may include interventions to improve insulin sensitivity
and protect brain health.
